# Scrum Tracker Fullstack Project
## Introduction

The Scrum Tracker Fullstack Project employs Spring Boot for authentication and authorization within its backend. It utilizes JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to securely generate and transfer authentication tokens to the Next.js frontend, enabling user access to system functionalities. This application serves as a scrum tracking tool, capturing scrum data and persisting it in a PostgreSQL database for efficient management and retrieval.

## Features

- **User Registration and Authentication**: The backend supports user registration and authentication using JWT tokens, ensuring secure access to the application.

- **Task and Issues Management**: The frontend enables users to create, update, and track tasks and issues within the Scrum process.

- **Effortless Collaboration**: With the integrated fullstack solution, team members can seamlessly collaborate on projects, update task statuses, and monitor progress.
